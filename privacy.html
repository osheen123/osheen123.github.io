                                    <i>Submission of Instructions:</i> You may submit a request to know or to delete by email to the address provided in the ‘Grievances’ section above or by submitting a request via mail to address provided by us in our Terms
                                    of Use or the Platform page. Regarding requests to delete, we may present you with the choice to delete select portions of your Personal Information, but a global option to delete all Personal Information will be offered and
                                    more prominently presented.

                                    <i>Verification Process:</i> We are required by law to verify the identities of those who submit requests to know or to delete. To determine whether the individual making the request is the consumer about whom we have
                                    collected information, we will verify your identity by matching the identifying information provided by you in the request to the Personal Information that we already maintain about you. As a part of this process, you will
                                    be required to provide your name and email address, and mobile number (if the same have been voluntarily provided by you at the time of registering on the Platform or otherwise while using the Platform). We will inform you
                                    if we cannot verify your identity. Please note-
                                    <br><br>

                                        If we cannot verify the identity of the person making a request for categories of Personal Information, we may deny the request. If the request is denied in whole or in part for this reason, we will provide a copy of, or
                                        direct you to, our Privacy Policy.

                                        If we cannot verify the identity of the person making the request for specific pieces of Personal Information, we are prohibited from disclosing any specific pieces of Personal Information to the requestor. However, if
                                        denied in whole or in part for this reason, we will evaluate the request as if it is seeking the disclosure of categories of Personal Information about the consumer.

                                        If we cannot verify the identity of the person making a request to delete, we may deny the request. If there is no reasonable method by which we can verify the identity of the requestor to the degree of certainty
                                        required, we will state this in our response and explain why we have no reasonable method by which we can verify the identity of the requestor.

                                    <i>Authorized Agents:</i> Authorized agents may submit requests via the methods identified in this Policy. If you use an authorized agent to submit a request to know or a request to delete, we may require you to: (1) provide
                                    the authorized agent with signed permission to do so; (2) verify your identity directly with us; and (3) directly confirm with us that you provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request. However, we will not
                                    require these actions if you have provided the authorized agent with power of attorney pursuant to the California Probate Code.

                                    <i>Excessive Requests:</i> If requests from a User are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of their repetitive character, we may either (1) charge a reasonable fee, or (2) refuse to act on the request
                                    and notify the User of the reason for refusing the request. If we charge a fee, the amount will be based upon the administrative costs of providing the information or communication or taking the action requested.

                                    and we do not discriminate against Users/consumers for exercising their rights under the CCPA.
